# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
Updates were made to the PlanMyTrip app. The following is a summary of the capabilities of the app:
- A weather description was added to the marker layer that displays the current weather.
- User will be able to input desired temperature range to filter and identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels.
- From the list of potential travel destinations, user will be able to choose cities to create a travel itinerary. As of now, the limit is four cities; however, this can be expanded by adding to the existing code. 
- Use Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route between the four chosen cities, which includes a marker layer map.
